# sandbox
My test working space for learning about git features with no risk of lost work.

To test small team working, there is a second user : ford-prefect-278128 with parallel accounts on machines and GitHub.

The first exercise involves each user creating their own feature branches and merging.

1.  avs updates the README.md file, commits and pushes back to origin master
2.  ford-prefect-278128 proposes to join forces on the sandbox project, with an initial small modification to README.md.   As requested by AdamVStephen, will also create a file called fp-topic-branches.md to document my feature contributions.


# Feature-1

A new really cool feature implemented in C is under production on branch feature-1.
